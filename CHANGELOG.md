## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- `--full-klipper-sweep` flag: clones Klipper shallowly and validates all 192+ official configs
- `--yaml-check` flag: validates `data/boards.yaml` schema, required keys, and pattern precedence
- `tests/sweep/result_codes.py`: four-code classification system (`PASS`, `SAFE_ABORT`, `UNSUPPORTED`, `FAILURE`)
- `tests/sweep/klipper_sweep.py`: offline-safe sweep engine with sparse git checkout
- Six new regression snapshot fixtures: Creality v4.2.2, Creality v4.2.7, Octopus v1.1, SKR Pico (RP2040), SKR v1.3 (LPC176x), SKR Mini E3 sensorless
- `VERSION` file: single source of truth for the project version
- `docs/RELEASE.md`: release engineering guide (versioning, tagging, rollback)
- `docs/en/ARCHITECTURE.md`: YAML schema reference, derivation pipeline, fallback logic
- `docs/en/TESTING.md`: test suite usage, snapshot system, CI workflow
- `docs/en/CONTRIBUTING.md`: board addition guide, PR checklist
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: full GitHub Actions CI pipeline with concurrency cancellation
- Full sweep runner and results summary (`SWEEP_RESULTS.md`)
- `tests/sweep/full_sweep_runner.py` and `tests/sweep/last_sweep_report.txt`

### Changed
- `tests/run_tests.py`: added `--yaml-check` and `--full-klipper-sweep` flags; improved help text
- `kace.py`: `--version` flag now reads from `VERSION` file; `__version__` kept in sync
- Added timeouts to network requests in scraper

### Fixed
- Pathing issues in generator, deployer, and test_derivation
- Wizard navigation step 0 bug
- Dashboard banner version display
